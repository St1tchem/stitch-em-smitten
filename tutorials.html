    <h1>Amigurumi Tips & Tricks</h1>
    <p>How lucky are you to have ended up here. These are the exact techniques I have discovered that give your amigurumis that crisp, well defined finish. I have created some photo tutorials below for you to follow below.</p>

        <h2>The Invisible Decrease</h2>
        <p>This decrease is much more discreet than a regular decrease which is perfect for keeping shapes like the head smooth and even. It also helps to eliminate small gaps that are sometimes left by a regular decrease.</p>

            <div class="inv-dec-text">Then yarn over (I do this in the x-stitch fashion with the yarn under the hook) and pull a single loop through both front loops on your hook.</div>
