    <h1>Amigurumi Tips & Tricks</h1>

    <div class="intro">
    <p>How lucky are you to have ended up here?! After I got the basic stitches down I spent so long being frustrated that my creations weren't coming out with that gorgeous crisp stitch definition I see all over the internet. To save you any more instagram induced stress I've created some photo tutorials of the exact techniques I have discovered that give your amigurumis a nice professional finish. All of the patterns you will find on here by myself use the following techniques throughout.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>The Cross Stitch</h2>
    <p>The cross stitch is a very simple variation of the regular single crochet that results in a boxy even texture with great stitch definition. I personally find it to even out the texture of my pieces and better hides the small lumps made from increasing and decreasing stitches. The fabric also feels a little thicker and more substantial. It is made by simply leaving the hook over the top of the yarn when we make a yarn over.</p>

            <div class="tutorial-text">This is how we yarn over to make a regular single crochet. The yarn passes over the top of the hook and is pulled through the stitch.</div>

    <h3>The Invisible Decrease</h3>
    <p>This decrease is much more discreet than a regular decrease which is perfect for keeping shapes like the head smooth and even. It also helps to eliminate small gaps that are sometimes left by a regular decrease.</p>
